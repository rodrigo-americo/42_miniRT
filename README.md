## Description

**miniRT** is a ray tracer built from scratch in pure C as a project for [42 School](https://42.fr). It renders 3D scenes described in `.rt` text files, producing images with realistic lighting using the Phong reflection model.

For each pixel on the screen, a ray is cast from the camera into the scene. When it intersects an object, the color is computed based on ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, shadows, and material properties:

```
P(t) = origin + t * direction
```

The visible object at each pixel is the one with the smallest positive `t` along the ray.

**Stack:** `C` · `MLX42` · `pthreads` · `CMake` · `Make`  
**School:** 42 São Paulo  
**Status:** ✅ Completed — mandatory + all bonus items implemented

## Instructions

### Dependencies

Before building, install the required system libraries.

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cmake glfw
```

> **Note:** `make` and `cc` (gcc or clang) are included in `build-essential` on Linux and in Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS (`xcode-select --install`).

MLX42 (the graphics library) is included as a Git submodule and compiled automatically via CMake on the first build — no manual installation required.

### Cloning

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rodrigo-americo/42_miniRT.git
cd 42_miniRT
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

```bash
make          # mandatory version  →  ./miniRT
make bonus    # bonus version      →  ./miniRT_bonus
make debug    # debug build
```

### Running

```bash
./miniRT scenes/complex.rt
./miniRT_bonus scenes/bonus_full.rt
```

- Pass any `.rt` scene file as the argument
- Press `ESC` or close the window to exit
- The window supports resizing

## Scene Format (`.rt`)

Scene files are plain text. Each line defines one element.

### Global elements (exactly 1 of each)

```
A <intensity> <R,G,B>            # Ambient light
C <x,y,z> <dx,dy,dz> <fov>      # Camera
L <x,y,z> <brightness> <R,G,B>  # Point light (multiple allowed)
```

### Objects

```
sp <x,y,z> <diameter> <R,G,B>
pl <x,y,z> <nx,ny,nz> <R,G,B>
cy <x,y,z> <ax,ay,az> <diameter> <height> <R,G,B>
cn <x,y,z> <ax,ay,az> <diameter> <height> <R,G,B>   # bonus only
```

### Bonus material parameters (optional, appended after color)

```bash
# Phong only
sp ... <R,G,B> <ks> <kd> <ka> <shininess> <reflectivity>

# Phong + checkerboard
sp ... <R,G,B> <ks> <kd> <ka> <shininess> <reflectivity> <R2,G2,B2> <checker_scale>

# Phong + checkerboard + bump mapping
sp ... <R,G,B> <ks> <kd> <ka> <shininess> <reflectivity> <R2,G2,B2> <checker_scale> <bump_scale> <bump_path>
# Use "none" as bump_path for procedural (sine-based) bump
```

Defaults when omitted: `KA=0.2` · `KD=0.7` · `KS=0.2` · `SHININESS=30` · `REFLECTIVITY=0`

### Minimal example

```
A 0.3 255,255,255
C 0,5,-20 0,-0.2,1 60
L -20,30,-10 0.8 255,255,255

sp 0,0,15 6.0 255,0,0
pl 0,-3,0 0,1,0 200,200,200
cy 0,-3,2 0,1,0 2.0 6.0 255,128,0
```

### Validations

- Exactly 1 camera (`C`) and 1 ambient light (`A`) per file
- File must have a `.rt` extension
- Intensities and brightness: `[0.0, 1.0]`
- RGB colors: `[0, 255]`
- Orientation vectors: components in `[-1.0, 1.0]`
- FOV: `[0, 180]`
- Diameter and height: positive values

### AI Usage

AI assistance (ChatGPT / GitHub Copilot) was used during this project for the following tasks:

- **Debugging geometric edge cases** — helping identify off-by-one errors in ray-cylinder cap intersection and cone height clamping.
- **Explaining math concepts** — clarifying tangent/bitangent frame construction for bump mapping and the derivation of quadratic discriminants.
- **Code review suggestions** — reviewing parser error handling logic and suggesting cleaner validation patterns.
- **No code was generated wholesale by AI.** All implementations were written and understood by the authors; AI was used as an interactive reference, not a code generator.
